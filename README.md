# Personal Portfolio – Pankaj Yadav

This is a customized version of the [Start Bootstrap - Personal](https://startbootstrap.com/template/personal/) template, tailored as a personal portfolio website for showcasing my background, skills, and projects. The original template was adapted to use [Formspree](https://formspree.io/) for handling contact form submissions instead of SB Forms.

## ✨ Key Features

- Clean, modern design built on Bootstrap 5  
- Responsive across all devices  
- 4 pages: Home, Resume, Projects, Contact  
- Working contact form via [Formspree](https://formspree.io/f/mjkogggy)  
- Pug templating for easier HTML management  
- Sass for custom styling
